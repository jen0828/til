# Web architectures : Monolithic vs. Headless vs. Composable

## Monolithic
Monolithic architecture is where one provider takes different functionality and puts it in one big solution. If you want to change one element on your site, then you often need to change it all.

## Headless
Headless architecture is where you separate the frontend - the web experience layer - from the monolithic backend. The advantage is that you can quickly iterate on the frontend experience without impacting the backend.

## Composable (i.e. Microservice)
Composable/ Microservice architecture is where functionality on the frontend and backend can be pluggable, scalable, replaceable, and able to be continuously improved through agile development.
